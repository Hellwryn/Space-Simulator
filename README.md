# Features

[Prodecural Galaxy Generation](pictures/image.png)
The Galaxy Generator creates between 250 and 5000 unique stars system to populate a procedurally-generated galaxy.

Each individual star system is fully populated with procedural planets.
The orbits are pseudo-realistic, I calculated orbits based on each planet mass and spin, but I'm no astrophysicist.

Each planet texture is based on a procedurally generated heightmap, then colored base on the temperature of the planet and water level.
